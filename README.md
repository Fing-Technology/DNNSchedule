# DNNSchedule
Example DNN scheduled task Project in C#

I have been building simple DNN scheduled tasks for a while and always found it a real pain to debug.
You have to installed the DLL in DNN and then attach to IIS in Visual Studio and then you have to hit "run now" in DNN to fire off the task.
There is usually a long wait before your breakpoints are hit and you can step through the code.
